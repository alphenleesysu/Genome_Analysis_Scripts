there are such three lines in r8s.input:
"
	line1. divtime method=PL crossv=yes cvstart=0 cvinc=1 cvnum=18;
	line2. set smoothing=1e+07;
	line3. divtime method=PL algorithm=TN;
"
# get a  smoothing value
	first, annotate the line2 and line3 and run:
	r8s -b -f r8s.input > smoothing.output

# run with the smmothing value obtained from above
	modify the smoothing value of line2, then run:
	r8s -b -f r8s.input > output
